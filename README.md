# ArcticWolf | Fortnite DataMiner, Mod & Bot

## Current State
I am currently not actively working on this project anymore. The Core worked in a previous version, but after I refactored the code to create a framework
the game crashes due to a memory exception and I can't fix it currently.

## Projects and their purpose
| Project | Purpose | Note |
|---------|---------|------|
| [ArcticWolf.Core](/ArcticWolf.Core/) | Fortnite modifications, which makes it possible to play v15.00 offline. Based on Neonite++ (but with better performance). | Fortnite crashes after starting a match due to code refactoring. |

| [ArcticWolf.Storage](ArcticWolf.Storage) | Contains models and the database system used by the API and the data miner | |
| [ArcticWolfApi](/ArcticWolfApi/) | Fortnite and EpicGames API clone used by ArcticWolf.Core to send custom data | I was too lazy to develop this myself so I used the code from the Rift project|
